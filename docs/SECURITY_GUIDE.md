### System Boundary Analysis

**Enterprise Network Boundary (Internal Trust Zone):**
- **Desktop Computing System**: Host for Outlook client; trusted endpoint within enterprise network perimeter
- **Outlook Client**: User's primary interface; trusted endpoint within enterprise network perimeter
- **PromptEmail Add-in**: Application execution environment; rendered in taskpane of Outlook client and constrained by Browser and Office sandboxeses
- **AWS Account**: Hosts server side resources for PromptEmail add-in
- **S3 Static Hosting**: Application delivery; contains only public application code, no sensitive data
- **API Gateway**: Telemetry collection endpoint; rate-limited and optional for security compliance
- **Lambda Functions**: Serverless processing; isolated runtime environment with minimal privileges
- **Exchange Email System**: Core email infrastructure; maintains all email content within enterprise boundary
- **Exchange Web Services (EWS)**: API interface for email access; leverages existing authentication and authorization
- **Moder Service System**: AI processing; user selects provider based on trust/compliance requirements
- **Optional Telemetry**: Usage metrics only; can be disabled for maximum security posture

    subgraph INHERITED[" "]
        TRANSPORT["üîê Layer 1: Transport Security<br/>(TLS, Certificates, HSTS)"]
        AUTH["üîë Layer 2: Authentication<br/>(Domain, Kerberos, RBAC)"]
        NETWORK["üåê Layer 5: Network Security<br/>(CORS, Firewalls, VPC)"]
    end
    
    style INHERITED fill:#f0f0f0,stroke:#888,stroke-dasharray: 5 5
```

### Layer 3: Data Processing Security ‚öôÔ∏è

        ENCRYPT[API Key Encryption]
    end
    
    style LOCAL fill:#90EE90
    style ENCRYPT fill:#90EE90
```

### Layer 4: Data Storage Security üíæ
```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph L4[" "]
        EXCHANGE[Exchange Mailbox Settings]
        LOCALSTOR[Browser LocalStorage]
        NOSTORE[No Server-Side Email Storage]
    end
    
    style NOSTORE fill:#90EE90
```



**‚¨ú Gray Components (Infrastructure-Inherited):**
- **Transport Security (TLS, HSTS, Certificate Pinning)**: Inherited from browser, Exchange, and AWS infrastructure
- **Authentication Controls (Domain Auth, Kerberos, NTLM, RBAC)**: Leveraged from existing Active Directory infrastructure  
- **Network Security (CORS, CSP, Firewalls, VPC)**: Combination of browser policies, enterprise network, and AWS controls
- **Storage Security (Exchange, LocalStorage)**: Utilizes existing Exchange server and browser security models

**üü© Green Components (PromptEmail-Controlled):**
- **No Server-Side Email Storage**: Direct application design decision - ensures email content never stored on backend
- **Client-Side Processing**: Application architecture choice - all email analysis occurs within user's browser
- **API Key Encryption**: Application-implemented security - uses Web Crypto API to protect AI service credentials
- **Content Sanitization**: Application-implemented data protection - removes dangerous content before AI processing
- **Email Content Truncation**: Application-controlled data minimization - limits sensitive data sent to external services

## 8. Known Security Risks & Mitigations

### Risk Assessment Summary

This section documents known security risks associated with the implementation architecture, along with compensating controls and mitigation strategies.

### Risk 1: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Configuration

**Risk Description:**
- **Issue**: CORS trust must be enabled between add-in domain and API Gateway for telemetry functionality
- **Security Impact**: Expands trust boundary to allow cross-origin requests from add-in to AWS endpoints
- **Attack Vector**: Potential for malicious scripts to leverage CORS permissions if add-in is compromised

**Compensating Controls:**
- **Restricted Origins**: CORS policy limited to specific add-in domains only
- **Method Restrictions**: Only POST methods allowed for telemetry endpoints
- **Header Validation**: Strict validation of allowed headers and content types
- **Rate Limiting**: API Gateway implements aggressive rate limiting per client IP
- **Optional Feature**: Telemetry can be completely disabled, eliminating this risk entirely
- **No Sensitive Data**: CORS endpoints only accept usage metrics, never email content

**Risk Level**: **LOW** - Limited scope with strong compensating controls

### Risk 2: S3 Bucket Encryption Limitations

**Risk Description:**
- **Issue**: Unable to implement customer-provided encryption (CPE) for S3 static hosting bucket
- **Security Impact**: Reliance on AWS-managed encryption instead of customer-controlled keys
- **Compliance Concern**: May not meet strictest data sovereignty requirements

**Technical Constraints:**
- **Static Hosting Requirement**: S3 static website hosting does not support CPE/BYOK encryption
- **CloudFront Limitations**: Customer-managed keys not supported for origin access
- **Public Read Access**: Static assets must be publicly readable for browser access

**Compensating Controls:**
- **Public Content Only**: S3 bucket contains only public application code, no sensitive data
- **No PII Storage**: No email content, user data, or credentials stored in S3
- **AWS-Managed AES-256**: Server-side encryption with AWS-managed keys still provides strong protection
- **Content Integrity**: Application code signed and integrity-verified at runtime
- **Access Logging**: All S3 access logged and monitored via CloudTrail
- **Version Control**: All static content under source control with audit trail

**Risk Level**: **VERY LOW** - No sensitive data at risk, strong alternative protections

### Risk 3: Direct AI Provider Connections

**Risk Description:**
- **Issue**: Email content transmitted directly to external AI providers (OpenAI, etc.)
- **Security Impact**: Sensitive data leaves enterprise boundary for processing
- **Privacy Concern**: Third-party AI providers process corporate email content

**Compensating Controls:**
- **User Choice**: Users explicitly select AI provider and consent to data processing
- **Content Sanitization**: Email content processed and sanitized before transmission
- **Content Truncation**: Large emails truncated to minimize data exposure
- **No Storage**: AI providers configured for zero data retention where possible
- **On-Premises Option**: Ollama and other local AI providers available as alternatives
- **Encryption in Transit**: All AI communications use HTTPS/TLS encryption
- **API Key Management**: User-controlled API keys, not shared or centralized

**Risk Level**: **MEDIUM** - User-accepted risk with strong compensating controls

### Risk 4: Browser LocalStorage Dependencies

**Risk Description:**
- **Issue**: User preferences and writing styles stored in browser LocalStorage
- **Security Impact**: Data persistence relies on browser security model
- **Data Loss Risk**: Clear browser data results in lost user configurations

**Compensating Controls:**
- **No Sensitive Data**: Only user preferences and writing style settings stored
- **Exchange Backup**: Critical settings also synchronized to Exchange mailbox
- **Encryption Support**: Web Crypto API used for sensitive data like API keys
- **Domain Isolation**: LocalStorage isolated per domain, not accessible cross-origin
- **User Control**: Users can export/import settings for backup
- **Graceful Degradation**: Application functions with default settings if storage unavailable

**Risk Level**: **LOW** - Limited impact with backup mechanisms

### Enterprise Risk Management

**Organizational Controls:**
- **Risk Register**: All identified risks documented in enterprise risk management system
- **Regular Assessment**: Quarterly security reviews and risk re-evaluation
- **Incident Response**: Security incident response procedures include add-in specific scenarios
- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of security controls and risk indicators

**Compliance Alignment:**
- **Risk Acceptance**: Documented risk acceptance by business stakeholders
- **Audit Trail**: All security decisions and trade-offs documented for compliance audit
- **Control Testing**: Regular testing of compensating controls effectiveness
- **Vendor Assessment**: AI provider security assessments when using external services
